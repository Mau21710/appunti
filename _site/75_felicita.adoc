=== Happiness Week 6

==== Terms of Happiness

Mindfulness:: Though exact definitions vary, Jon Kabat-Zinn and others generally define "mindfulness" as a non-judgmental, moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. When we practice mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future.

The "non-judgmental" part of the definition refers to the idea that mindfulness involves acceptance, meaning that we pay attention to our thoughts and feelings without judging them--without believing, for instance, that there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel in a given moment.

Meditation:: Though mindfulness and meditation are closely related, they are not synonymous. As Jon Kabat-Zinn describes in his video, one can practice mindfulness while not doing a formal meditation practice, and there are many different kinds of meditation that go beyond mindfulness meditation. The term "meditation" refers to a wide range of practices that simply involve training the mind to achieve a particular state of consciousness, especially for relaxation. That said, mindfulness meditation, based on a technique adapted from Buddhist Vipassana meditation, is a basic and commonly practiced form of meditation.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR):: Though it has its roots in Buddhist meditation, a secular practice of mindfulness has entered the mainstream in recent years largely through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and his Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, which he launched at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979. The MBSR program usually has students meet for two to three hours per week for eight weeks, practicing at home between classes. They learn practices such as the "body scan," in which they focus their attention along each part of the body, trying to be aware and accepting of whatever they sense in these body parts, and the "raisin meditation," where they slowly use all of their senses, one after another, to observe a raisin in great detail, from the way it feels in their hand to the way its taste bursts on the tongue. Over the past 35 years, thousands of studies have documented the physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness in general and MBSR in particular, inspiring countless programs to adapt the MBSR model for schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and beyond. We'll learn more about these programs later in the week.

Attention:: According to psychologist and philosopher William James, attention "is the taking possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thoughts…It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others." Many compare attention to a spotlight, which makes certain information from the inside or outside world more available to conscious awareness, while filtering out less useful information. Attention is limited, in that it can only hold a finite quantity of information in mind for a limited period of time, and selective, in that it orients to information that is deemed important in a given moment.

Awareness:: Self-awareness points to the ability to attain insight into one's own attitudes, motives, reactions, strengths and vulnerabilities.


==== Happiness Practice # 5: Mindfulness

Mindful Breathing:: La meditazione basilare è portare l'attenzione sul tuo respiro, inspirare ed espirare. Si può fare in qualunque posizione. I tuo occhi possono essere aperti o chiusi, anche se ad occhi chiusi potrebbe essere possibile mantenere la concentrazione. Può essere utile impostare un tempo per questo esercizio ma anche praticarlo in casi di stress o ansia. L'importante è respirare normalmente e osservare tutte le sensazioni derivanti dal nostro respirare. link:../audios/mindfulness/body-scan_ITA.mp3[Link file Audio]

==== Self compassion

3 Components:

* Self kindness (vs self judgment)
* Common humanity (vs Isolation)
* Mindfulness (vs Over-identification)

Other confusion:

* Discrimination between harsh judgement and discriminating wisdom
* confusion with self judgment
* making excuses
* motivation requires self motivation
* self criticism fear to be weak, gives the illusion of control
* is not passive and complesand

Self compassion it's more like a father with a son. +
is self acceptance, not self improvement! +
is watering we as seeds!

	** the point of view is to accept 
	** no one is without flows
	** factors contributing bad qality
- Leggete la lettera e rileggetela

[quote, Maurizio Stagni]
*Tema*: Quando sono in stress reagisto male con le persone.
Mi fa sentire operativo, ma crudele. +
*Svolgimento*: Non è un problema così brutto. Capita a molti, soprattutto in caso di stress, di essere meno lucidi e meno empatici.
Pochi si piacciono per quel che sono e nessuno è privo di difetti.
PEnsa a quante altre persone si stanno struggendo per lo stesso problema. 
Forse è l'ansia di non farcela che ti genera queste reazioni. Ti fa essere inutilmente duro con te e, in quetsi casi, anche con gli altri.
Pensiamo assieme a cosa puoi fare per migliorarti. Il mio suggerimento intanto è quello di accettarti maggiormente per tutte le cose belle che sei, e di provare a scalzare quella paura del fallimento che continua a perseguirti quotidianamente.
Prova a dormire un poco di più, come indice che ti stai rispettando e che non stai lasxciando che sia la paura a controllare le tue azioni. +
Con affetto +
Te stesso

.Dettaglio dell'esercizio

Time Required:: 15 minutes. Try to do this practice once per week, or at least once per month.

How to do it::
	First, identify something about yourself that makes you feel ashamed, insecure, or not good enough. It could be something related to your personality, behavior, abilities, relationships, or any other part of your life. Once you identify something, write it down and describe how it makes you feel. Sad? Embarrassed? Angry? Try to be as honest as possible, keeping in mind that no one but you will see what you write. The next step is to write a letter to yourself expressing compassion, understanding, and acceptance for the part of yourself that you dislike. As you write, follow these guidelines:
	
	. Imagine that there is someone who loves and accepts you unconditionally for who you are. What would that person say to you about this part of yourself?
	. Remind yourself that everyone has things about themselves that they don’t like, and that no one is without flaws. Think about how many other people in the world are struggling with the same thing that you’re struggling with.
	. Consider the ways in which events that have happened in your life, the family environment you grew up in, or even your genes may have contributed to this negative aspect of yourself. 
	. In a compassionate way, ask yourself whether there are things that you could do to improve or better cope with this negative aspect. Focus on how constructive changes could make you feel happier, healthier, or more fulfilled, and avoid judging yourself.
	. After writing the letter, put it down for a little while. Then come back to it later and read it again. It may be especially helpful to read it whenever you’re feeling bad about this aspect of yourself, as a reminder to be more self-compassionate.

==== Finding Flow

Have you ever been so engaged in an activity that you lost all sense of time? Hours passed, but you didn't notice; you felt calm, focused, deeply satisfied, even meditative? +
Psychologists have a word for that mental state: *(((flow)))*. 

* When we feel flow we forget of ourself
* lose track of time
* more creative and productive

Flow feels good

.What is needed to have flow
First and most importantly, they’re doing something where their skills match the challenge of the task. If the challenge is too great for their skills, they get frustrated; if the task isn’t challenging enough, they simply get bored.  Second, flow occurs when the goal is clear, and third, when there’s constant and immediate feedback about how close you are to achieving that goal. Fourth, flow occurs when you’re free to fully concentrate on the task.

.Team flow
1.  The group’s goal
2.  Close listening
3. Keep it moving forward (yes and..)
4. Complete concentration
5. Being in control: a paradox: Each participant must feel in control while at the same time remaining flexible, listening closely, and always being willing to defer to the emergent flow of the group. The most innovative teams are the ones that can manage that paradox.
6.  Blending egos
7. Equal participation
8.  Familiarity. in impro: “Don’t deny” and “Show, don’t tell.”
9. Communication
10. The potential for failure

.Goals

* Non zero goals (career, material gain)
* Increase feeling of authonomy, competence, relatedness
* Intrinsic goals (deep and lastig relashionship)

.Tems
Optimism:: Within the field of positive psychology, particularly informed by the work of the late researcher Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan, optimism is defined as the expectation that the future will be socially desirable, good, and pleasurable.
Maximizers:: A term popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz of Swarthmore College to refer to people who try to squeeze the greatest amount of benefit and pleasure out of every choice or opportunity. 
Satisficers:: by contrast, feel content with choices as long as they pass a basic threshold of acceptability. Schwartz and colleagues have found that maximizers report low happiness and optimism and higher levels of depression than people who have a greater tendency to satisfice.
Self-compassion:: Kristin Neff, who pioneered the scientific study of self-compassion, generally defines it as quieting one's inner critic and replacing it with a voice of support, understanding, and care for one’s self--in other words, treating yourself with the same kind of compassion that you show to other people. By Neff's account, there are three core components of self-compassion: 
	. self-kindness, meaning that we are gentle and understanding with ourselves rather than harshly critical and judgmental; 
	. recognizing our common humanity, meaning that we feel connected to others in the experience of life rather than feeling isolated and alienated by our suffering; 
	. mindfulness, meaning that we are aware of our pain or suffering but keep that observation in perspective, rather than ignoring our pain or exaggerating it.
Flow:: A concept developed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi that refers to "the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it," four factors that are essential to flow: :
	. performing a task or activity where the degree of challenge is properly balanced with one's ability to complete it; 
	. one's goal is clear; 
	. there’s constant and immediate feedback about how close one is to achieving that goal; 
	. one is able to devote complete concentration to the task at hand.	
Intrinsic goals:: According to positive psychologist Tim Kasser and colleagues, intrinsic goals "are those that are inherently satisfying to pursue because they are likely to satisfy innate psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, and growth"; they depend on satisfying one's own basic psychological needs rather than relying upon the judgments or approval of others. Examples of these goals include self-acceptance, forming social connections, and physical fitness.
Extrinsic goals:: on the other hand, are focused on attaining rewards and/or praise from others--they are a means to an end, not inherently rewarding in and of themselves. Examples include financial wealth, fame, or popularity. People often pursue extrinsic goals under the assumption that these goals will bring them happiness, but evidence suggests otherwise. Researchers speculate that intrinsic goals lead to greater happiness because, in the pursuit of these goals, people have positive experiences along the way that support their happiness.

.Esercizio: BEST POSSIBLE SELF

For the next 15 minutes, write continuously in the space below about what you imagine this best possible future to be. Use the instructions below to help guide you through this process.
. It may be easy for this exercise to lead you to examine how your current life may not match this best possible future. You may be tempted to think about ways in which accomplishing goals has been difficult for you in the past, or about financial/time/social barriers to being able to make these accomplishments happen. For the purpose of this exercise, however, we encourage you to focus on the future—imagine a brighter future in which you are your best self and your circumstances change just enough to make this best possible life happen.  
. This exercise is most useful when it is very specific—if you think about a new job, imagine exactly what you would do, who you would work with, and where it would be. The more specific you are, the more engaged you'll be in the exercise and the more you’ll get out of it.  
. Be as creative and imaginative as you want, and don’t worry about grammar or spelling.
 
[quote, Maurizio Stagni]
Tra cinque anni arriverò all'età di 45. Esteticamente nessuno mi associa a quell'età. Anche i capelli hanno ricominciato a crescere. Sarò finalmente soddisfatto del mio fisico e delle attività che faccio. Al lavoro, da qualche settimana do il meglio di me e tutti attorno a me sembrano essere più felici. TRa cinque anni l'azienda si sarà accorta di questo effetto e, con crescente sorpresa mi avrà ampliato responsabilità lasciandomi lavorare al benessere dei dipendenti per poterli far rendere al meglio. Nel frattempo imparerò come poter cindividere le scoperte sul flow e la felicità perchè tutti vedranno che con inapparente sforzo tutti gli eventi portano ad un benessere maggiore per me e per chi mi sta vicino. Tutti saranno trasformati e lavorerò nell'azienda più felice d'Italia, verrò incaricato di condividere la mia esperienza anche con le filiali estere e comincerò a valutare di operare una start up, spinto dall'agente che mi aiuta nella pubblicazione dei saggi e dei libri di narrativa che sembrano uscire come per magia dalla mia mente. Tutta la mia famiglia sarà felice, ed avremo tempo per viaggiare attorno al mondo per un tour che organizzerò per promuovere la filosofia "Make it happien" attorno a tutto il globo. Ogni tappa mi permetterà di provare a conoscere la realtà e di far si che riusciamo a goderci tutto il bello del posto e della gente che lo abita. Il tour mondiale mi aprirà nuovi orizzonti e mi sentirò veramente parte dell'umanità.

.Goal visualisation

TIME REQUIRED:: 10 minutes daily for 3 weeks
HOW TO DO IT::
	. Identify one goal that you would like to achieve in the next day or two and briefly describe it in writing. Make sure that this goal is realistic and not too time-consuming (e.g., “tidy up the hall closet” rather than “clean the entire house top to bottom”) and something that is important to you (e.g., “spend more time with the kids” rather than “learn about the life cycle of the common fly”).
	. To help you visualize how you will go about accomplishing this goal, describe in writing the steps that you will take to get there.
	
		.. schedule one hour tonight that you will devote to cleaning;
		.. turn off your cell phone/other distractors;
		.. put on some comfortable clothes;
		.. turn on some upbeat music;
		.. break down the job into sub-tasks: take everything out of the closet, sweep the floor, dust the shelves, get rid of stuff that you don’t need any more, sort the things that you want to keep and put them in boxes, put the boxes back in the closet;
		.. remind yourself that it’s ok if you don’t do everything perfectly, or complete the entire task.
