==== Momentuous Kindness

* one person's generosity can have a ripple effect, spreading by three degrees through a social network
* "elevation," which refers to the warm, uplifting feeling we get when we witness someone else's good deed
 ** Social disgust can then be understood as the emotional reaction people have to witness­ing others moving “down,” or exhibiting their lower, baser, less God-like nature
* One way to think about "scaling up" kindness is to consider how we might increase the frequency of altruistic acts. But another way is to consider how we might increase their intensity.

* heroism is different from altruism or compassion
  ** Few people do evil; fewer people act heroically. Between these extremes in the bell curve of humanity are the masses, the general population who do nothing, 
  ** It’s about a concern for other people in need, a concern to develop, to defending a moral cause knowing there is a personal cause or risk. That’s the key. And you do it without expectation of reward. 
    *** So altruism is heroism light.
    *** Compassion is a virtue that may lead to heroism, but we don’t know. Nobody’s established said link. 
  ** Heroic Imagination Project
  ** heroes are most effective not alone, not the, the soldier in, in battle who takes a bullet for his buddy, but forming a network.
* THE HEROIC IMAGINATION PROJECT
  ** "No man is an island (or no woman) ... entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main... Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in all of mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." 
  ** Yoda tells us: "Do or do not. There is no 'try.'" It's time to take action. Against evil.
* Steps for HIP
    . We can start by remaining mindful, carefully and critically evaluating each situation we encounter so that we don’t gloss over an emergency requiring our action. We should try to develop our “discontinuity detector”—an awareness of things that don’t fit, are out of place, or don’t make sense in a setting. This means asking questions to get the information we need to take responsible action.
    . It is important not to fear interpersonal conflict, and to develop the personal hardiness necessary to stand firm for principles we cherish. In fact, we shouldn’t think of difficult interactions as conflicts but rather as attempts to challenge other people to support their own principles and ideology.
    . We must remain aware of an extended time-horizon, not just the present moment. We should be engaged in the current situation, yet also be able to detach part of our analytical focus to imagine alternative future scenarios that might play out, depending on different actions or failures to act that we take in the present. In addition, we should keep part of our minds on the past, as that may help us recall values and teachings instilled in us long ago, which may inform our actions in the current situation.
    . We have to resist the urge to rationalize inaction and to develop justifications that recast evil deeds as acceptable means to supposedly righteous ends.
    . We must try to transcend anticipating negative consequence associated with some forms of heroism, such as being socially ostracized. If our course is just, we must trust that others will eventually recognize the value of our heroic actions.

    
==== Cooperation & Happiness

Che altro dire?

==== CONFLICT AND PEACEMAKING

* Bla Bla pconflitto e perdonare
* _Fatto_ when subjects are presented with a face of someone from a different race, the amygdala gets metabolically active. This happens even when the face is presented subliminally, which is to say, so rapidly that the subject does not consciously see it. Test a person who has a lot of experience with people of different races, and the amygdala does not activate. Or, as in a wonderful experiment by Susan Fiske, of Princeton University, subtly bias the subject beforehand to think of people as individuals rather than as members of a group, and the amygdala does not budge.
* Soffisi imbarazzati - Esercizio

==== Perdono, almeno uno di entrambi i punti

* Chiedere Scusa
    ** Esprimere rimorso
    ** Dichiarare d'aver compreso l'offesa / riconoscimento responsabilità
    ** Offrire empatia / spiegazione
    ** Riparare / offrire risarcimento
    ** Assicurare che sarà difficile che ricapiti
* Perchè
    ** dignità recuperata
    ** valori condivisi / ammissione che il danno era un atto errato
    
.Perdono e vendetta

Because revenge and forgiveness both solved problems for ancestral humans, these capacities are now typical of modern humans.

* la vittima non era responsabile dell'offesa
* rassicura la vittima che è al sicuro
* Giustizia riparatrice (offendente viene punito)
* Riparazione, compensazione per il dolore
* DIalogo che permette alla vittima di esprimere le proprie emozioni verso l'offeso e di compartecipare alle perdite
